# Computer Vision for Smart Interaction

This project implements a real-time object detection system using YOLOv8 and OpenCV. It can detect and recognize real-world objects using a webcam and provide AI-driven interactions based on the detected objects.

## Features

- Train a custom YOLO model on the COCO dataset
- Real-time object detection using webcam feeds
- Object-triggered AI interactions
- Optimized for speed and efficiency
- User-friendly interface with Streamlit

## Installation
